Description: This package provides tutorials for Tidy Modeling with R by
  Max Kuhn and Julia Silge. In an ideal world, students would read the book
  and type in all the associated R commands themselves. Sadly, that often does
  not happen. These tutorials allow students to demonstrate (and their
  instructors to be sure) that all work has been completed. See the
  tutorial.helpers package for a background discussion of the tool and approach.
