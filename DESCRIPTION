Description: Tutorials for Tidy Modeling with R by Max Kuhn and Julia Silge.
  In an ideal world, students would read the book and type in all the
  associated R commands themselves. Sadly, that often does not happen.
  These tutorials allow students to demonstrate (and their instructors to be
  sure) that all work has been completed. See the tutorial.helpers package
  for a background discussion of the tool and approach.
