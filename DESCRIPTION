Description: When assigned "Tidy Modeling with R: A Framework for Modeling in
  the Tidyverse" (Kuhn and Silge (2023, ISBN: 1492096482)), students should
  read the book and type in all the associated R commands themselves. Sadly,
  that never happens. These tutorials allow students to demonstrate (and their
  instructors to be sure) that all work has been completed. See Kane (2023)
